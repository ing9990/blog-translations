# üßë‚Äçüíª Contribution Guide

This repository is a space for sharing Korean translations of various technical blog posts.  
Feel free to contribute your own translations by following the guide below.  
New contributions are always welcome!

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Add a Translated Post

1. Start by copying [`TRANSLATION_TEMPLATE.md`](../TRANSLATION_TEMPLATE.md) and creating a new `.md`
   file based on it.

2. Create a **topic-appropriate directory** under the `blog/` folder and place your translation
   there:
    - `blog/devops/kubernetes/`
    - `blog/frontend/react/`
    - `blog/ios/swiftui/`
    - `blog/blockchain/consensus/`
    - If a directory for the topic already exists, simply add your file there.

3. Once you're done writing, open a Pull Request (PR).

## üîñ Notes

- Always include the original post‚Äôs source URL at the top of your markdown file.
- If you encounter awkward or ambiguous expressions in translation, include the original sentence in
  a code block for clarity.

Thank you üôè
