## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Add a Translation

---

1. Copy the [`TRANSLATION_TEMPLATE.md`](../TRANSLATION_TEMPLATE.md) file and create a new `.md`
   file.

2. Create a **topic-specific folder** under the `docs/` directory and place your translation file
   inside.
    - Examples:
        - `/docs/Kor/kubernetes/`
        - `/docs/Frontend/React/`
        - `/docs/IOS/SwiftUI/`
        - `/docs/Blockchain/Consensus/`
    - If the folder does not exist yet, feel free to create it. If it already exists, just add your
      file inside.

3. Name your file using PascalCase + Snake_Case format.
    - Example: `Hello_My_Name_Is_Blah.md`

4. Once you're done translating, please submit a Pull Request (PR).

## üîñ Notes

---

- Please make sure to **include the original source link** at the top of the Markdown file.
- If there are any awkward or unclear translations, **include the original sentence using a code
  block** for clarity.

**Thank you for your contribution!** üôè
